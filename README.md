# react-calculator

A simple calculator made from React. Math.js was used to simplify the calculations. In this calculator, % is modulus, not percent. It will calculate the mod (ex. 9%4 = 1) instead of converting it into a decimal. Press C to clear after each use, or numbers will continue to append to the previous calculation.
